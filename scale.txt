As your movie rental system grows, feature enhancements can improve scalability by reducing bottlenecks inside the application itself. For example, adding smarter stock-management logic (like reserved stock during checkout) prevents race conditions when multiple users try to rent the same movie. Introducing pagination, filtering, and search for available movies and rental history reduces heavy database scans. Caching frequently accessed data—such as popular movies, genres, or rental price rules—minimizes repeated queries. Separating read models (for availability and history) from write operations (checkout and return) helps the application remain fast even as data volume increases.

Additional features like background processing for late fee calculations, automatic overdue reminders, and asynchronous return processing keep the main API responsive during peak load. Adding user-specific rate limiting protects the rental system from accidental overload. Audit logs, soft-delete cleanup jobs, and improved validation rules also contribute to long-term stability as the number of rentals, customers, and movies grows. These enhancements allow the rental platform to scale smoothly while maintaining a clean, predictable user experience.
